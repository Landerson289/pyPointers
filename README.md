* move(variable, location) Move where a variable is stored
* set(byte, value) Set a byte to a new value
* occupied(byte) Returns a bool which indicates if a byte is being used or not
* read(byte) Returns whatever is stored at that value
* longRead(byte1, byte2) Returns whatever is inbetween the two bytes
* longSet(byte1, byte2, value) Sets inbetween the two bytes to the value
